Anyway, lets say you are on Solaris 10 or older: Your /etc/nsswitch.conf should have an entry like this:

hosts:  files dns

This tells the Solaris Naming Service that hosts should be looked up first in the local file 
(i.e. /etc/hosts) and then in DNS. You can of course also only have "dns" here but people will 
normally want it so that /etc/hosts can override what is in DNS.


Solaris 10 installation steps using serial port 

restart the naming service daemon:
	svcadm restart /system/name-service-cache


verify your naming service setup:
	getent hosts google.com


Delete Default
-----------------
route delete default 10.40.19.186

netstat -rn  

list down netstat




export https_proxy=http://10.40.2.36:3128
echo $http_proxy


To identify the boot device at OK prompt :
	ok> printenv boot-device
boot-device = rootdisk mirrordisk

#prtconf -vp | grep bootpath

==========
1. go to bash : bash
2. ip info: ifconfig -a
3. set ip: ifconfig bge0 10.40.19.22/24
4. to view route table: netstat -rn
5. default gateway: route add default 10.40.19.254
6. delete default: route delete default 10.40.19.186
7. set proxy temporary: 
	export https_proxy=http://10.40.2.36:3128
	echo $http_proxy
8. add dns:
	edit /etc/resolv.conf file.

	nameserver 10.40.18.1
	nameserver 10.40.1.2

9. to check if a name is resolved: nslookup www.google.com

10. edit /etc/hosts file

	127.0.0.1	localhost 
	10.40.19.22	sla-test	loghost	

11. /etc/nsswitch.conf should have an entry like this:
